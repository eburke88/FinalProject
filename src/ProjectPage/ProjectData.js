The fact that the body of the building is underground means that the structure is quite simple save the unique sloped roof. More specifically, I was interested in the condition of the four sides of the building being flat and straight while the middle is sloped. The interplay between the rigid sides and the dynamic, flowing roof to me gave the impression of liquid within a container. The shape of the roof reminded me of a living creature travelling just under the water’s surface. This concept of water, especially moving within a container and coming into contact with the immovable sides became the basic inspiration for expanding upon the structural concept of the gymnasium. I imagined different snapshots of water shifting, and then applied a process and logic to it. Naturally, the first step was to shift the water into a different position. I chose to do this by bringing it to the sides of the “container” through splitting, rotating, and translating. Next I chose to dramatize these new curves to create a heightened sense of volume and tension between the surface and the sides. To alter the actual footprint of the building, I used taper to create a contrast not only in the vertical but also the horizontal direction, between the two sides of the building. From here, I used this dynamic shape as a base unit for a larger system, looking to create interesting gaps between the shapes.",
